{"name":"SVG Gradient Generator","body":"When building a “responsive” web site, it’s useful to keep everything on the\r\npage scalable by using vector images wherever possible. Buttons are one of the\r\nelements that often create a challange, with all of their glossy roundness and\r\ngradients galore.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project to make the process of creating plain HTML buttons\r\n(styled with CSS) really easy by giving you the gradient as an SVG image that\r\nwill work in all modern browsers (while still looking decent in the older\r\nones, since a solid fall-back color is provided).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nhttp://dabblet.com/gist/2341446\r\n\r\nSVG gradients are useful for lots of other things too, like backgrounds within\r\na module or even the whole page. That’s the beauty of a vector image; it’s\r\nonce-size-fits-all.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to use the tool, it’s hosted here:\r\nhttp://jimbomatic.com/gradient/\r\n\r\n### Data URI\r\n\r\nTo save an HTTP request (which is good for keeping the page-load time short)\r\nand to spare you the trouble of hosting an image file, the generator also\r\nencodes the SVG image as a Data URI. (This should also work in all of the\r\nbrowsers that support SVG.)\r\n","tagline":"A quick way to make a scalable background gradient (for page backgrounds, links, and buttons, styled with CSS).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
